            <p class="read-more-wrap">Wine has been produced for thousands of years. The earliest evidence of wine in Georgia from 6000 BC, Iran from 5000 BC, and Sicily from 4000 BC.
                <br><br>
                <span class="read-more-target">
                The earliest archaeological evidence of wine produced from grapes has been found at sites in China (c. 7000 BC), Georgia (c. 6000 BC), Lebanon 
                (c. 5000 BC), Iran (c. 5000 BC), Greece (c. 4500 BC), and Sicily (c. 4000 BC). The oldest extant evidence of wine production has been found in Armenia (c. 4100 BC).
                <br><br>
                The altered consciousness produced by wine has been considered religious since its origin. The ancient Greeks worshiped Dionysus or Bacchus and the Ancient Romans carried on his cult.
                Consumption of ritual wine was part of Jewish practice since Biblical times and, as part of the eucharist commemorating Jesus's Last Supper, became even more essential to the Christian Church.
                Although Islam nominally forbade the production or consumption of wine, during its Golden Age, alchemists such as Geber pioneered wine's distillation for medicinal and industrial purposes such
                as the production of perfume.
                <br><br>
                
                Wine production and consumption increased, burgeoning from the 15th century onwards as part of European expansion. Despite the devastating 1887 phylloxera louse infestation, 
                modern science and technology adapted and industrial wine production and wine consumption now occur throughout the world.

            <p class="read-more-wrap">Chardonnay: <br>

            Chardonnay is a medium to full-bodied white wine that is grown globally but holds its own as the most popular wine varietal in America. The best types of Chardonnay are oaked-aged and have a buttery mouthfeel. Crisp fruit flavors like apple and pear are combined with citrus aromas and hints of spice and vanilla. Drink Chardonnay with creamy sauces or chicken dishes for a perfect pairing. 
            <span class="read-more-target">
            <br><br><br>
            Riesling:
            <br> 

            Riesling is the flagship wine of Germany, originating in the country’s Rhine Valley. Riesling is at first sweet and acidic but balances out with honey flavors and a significant minerality. Riesling is great for pairing with spicy Asian cuisines or rich foods like pork.
            <br><br><br>
            Pinot Grigio: <br>

            Pinot Grigio is a quintessential Italian white wine. This wine type can be described as light, dry and refreshing with crisp fruit flavors like apple or pear. A different style of cultivation produces more medium-bodied wines that have floral aromas and a hint of minerality. Although both styles can be considered the same wine, the latter style typically bears the name Pinot Gris rather than Pinot Grigio. Both Pinot Gris and Pinot Grigio are best paired with seafood, more specifically shellfish.
            <br><br><br>
            Sauvignon Blanc: <br>

            Sauvignon Blanc is a light, dry and crisp white wine that has citrus notes and grassy aromas. When aged in oak, the wine has spice and vanilla flavors, as well. Although it tastes great with grilled chicken or vegetables, Sauvignon Blanc is a perfect pair for scallops or other shellfish.

                <p class="read-more-wrap">
                Cabernet Sauvignon: <br>
                Cabernet Sauvignon is the gem of Napa Valley. A full-bodied red wine, “Cabs” can typically be described as rich and robust. Most commonly aged in French oak, dark fruit flavors are combined with spices and other earthy aromas. The perfect pair for a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon is a juicy steak or other form of red meat.
                <span class="read-more-target">
                <br><br><br>
                Pinot Noir: <br>

                Pinot Noir is a light to medium-bodied red wine whose grapes flourish in colder climates. Described as smooth and fruit-forward, Pinot Noir has red-fruit aromas, most commonly cherry, and just a hint of spices and earthiness. A great Pinot Noir typically has a long, lingering finish. Pinot Noir pairs best with wild game or veal.
                <br><br><br>
                Syrah: <br>

                Syrah is a bold and rich red wine. Notes of dark fruits, pepper and spice are staples of the varietal. Australia’s style of Syrah is known as Shiraz and is much more sweet and jam-like than the “Old World” style of Syrah. Both versions are rich in fruit flavors, yet notably complex. Syrah is perfect for hearty and rich meat dishes, most specifically venison.
                <br><br><br>
                Zinfandel: <br>

                Zinfandel is one of the only grapes thought to be indigenous to America. Grown exclusively in California, this versatile wine has a range of different styles. Most commonly, Zinfandel is aged in American oak, giving the jam-like ripe fruit flavors an earthy spiciness. Zinfandel is also known as one of the more alcoholic wine types, packing a rich punch. Although it is known to go great with a wide variety of foods, this varietal’s perfect pairing is smoked or grilled meats.
                <br><br><br>
                Malbec: <br>

                Malbec, although originally produced in France, has been popularized by the Mendoza region in Argentina. This wine is a full-bodied, deep red wine that has dark berry fruit flavors and moderate tannins. Malbec is a great pairing for steak or other grilled meats.
                <br><br><br>
                Merlot: <br>

                Merlot is a popular wine of America’s western growing regions, while remaining one of the more prominent grapes in Bordeaux. Merlot is much like Cabernet Sauvignon only more fruit-forward. Red fruit flavors and aromas are made complex by smooth tannins, as well as spice and vanilla notes, which are evidence of oak-aging. Merlot tastes fabulous when paired with a hamburger or, more exotically, with lamb or duck.
