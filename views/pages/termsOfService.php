<h4>§ 7 Prices, discounts and shipping costs</h4>
<br>
7.1 All prices consist of the net amount of the product (the membership), minus a possible discount, and if applicable, of the Value Added Tax of the home country of the purchaser. The costs are determined by the extent and duration of the chosen membership.
The for the purchaser valid Value Added Tax will be shown in the order form together with the resulting total amount charged after entering all data.
<br>
7.2.1 We offer discounts for our SobiPro club memberships on various occasions. These discounts are activated via a coupon code, which must be entered in the corresponding field (coupon code) BEFORE the purchase of the membership.
<br>
7.2.2 Furthermore, we can offer discounts for renewing SobiPro Club memberships (Bronze, Silver, Gold). The renewal must be done before expiry of the current membership. The amount of the discount granted depends on the remaining term of the current membership. The reduced price is displayed together with the regular price. The discount is automatically deducted. The new membership seamlessly connects to the ongoing membership. A discount for renewing is only granted if the same or a higher plan is chosen. No discount for renewing will be granted if a lower plan is chosen, or after expiry of the membership.
<br>
7.2.3 We do not grant discounts for product memberships.
<br>
7.2.4 Discounts are not combinable. If a renewing discount is applicable and a valid coupon code is entered, the higher of the two discounts is granted but not both.
<br>
7.2.5 No discount can be granted after conclusion of the contract. The final price (Total charge) displayed at the time of the purchase (pressing the button "Subscribe with obligation to pay!") is final. Problems with activating a discount have to be indicated before purchase.
<br>
7.2.6 All discounts granted are a voluntary service on our part. We can change the amount of discounts at any time or cease them completely. There is no entitlement to a discount or to a certain amount of a discount.
<br>
7.3 Since we supply digital downloads and services exclusively, there are, in principle, no shipping costs. In the case of supply by downloading via a network, the seller bears the costs of making the software available for download on the network, and the purchaser bears the costs of the download and the accruing costs to access the Internet to get support and the online documentation.
</p>
<br><br><br>

<h4>§ 8 Payment conditions</h4>
<br>
<p>
8.1 Payment is to be made in advance, either by bank transfer or via PayPal. We reserve the right to refuse individual methods of payment. When you choose the bank transfer payment method, we will provide our bank account details to you in the confirmation of order. Please always quote the order number as a reference, because otherwise we cannot allocate your transfer.
The invoice amount is to be transferred to our account within 10 days. The club access is enabled only after the money has reached our bank or PayPal account.
<br>
8.2 If you have a valid Value Added Tax number in another EU country, then, in accordance with § 4 No.1 b of the UStG [Value Added Tax Act] or Reverse Charge Procedure, we can send you an invoice excluding Value Added Tax once you have advised the number to us in the order form.
The validation of the Value Added Tax number is done automatically after leaving the input field for the number [VAT Number (for EU customers)]. Please check if you see "VAT number correct" appearing. We can issue an invoice without Value Added Tax Only in this case.
If the value of the order is less than €100.00 net, we may charge a processing fee of €5.00 for this.
<br>
8.3 Purchases from non-EU countries are generally regarded as VAT-exempt.
<br>
8.4 Once payment becomes overdue, interest will be charged on the purchase price at a rate of 5% above the base rate during the overdue period. We reserve the right to substantiate, and claim for, any greater loss resulting from the delay in payment.

Alternatively, we may treat your payment as gross amount and adapt the term of your membership accordingly. The processing fee will be charged in any case.
